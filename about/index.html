      <p>First of all this is not a post about photography. No fricking way. Just look at these shots. Photography is one of those things which makes me feel 19 years younger. By the way I am 20.<br> So what's this about? It's about my habit of walking one and a half hour after dark. Now let's discuss why I feel good about it.
       My neighbourhood is way far from hustle & bustle of Jaipur City. It's a peaceful place with very sparsely located houses and many (many many!) open fields. This place sounds beautiful at night. Crickets crickety-cricking and trains rackatty-racking in distance.But it's not always about hearing. Sometimes with music on my headphones, there's is a calmness here. Even if you are listening to a podcast about 'how jihadi extremists can be converted with therapy'. It's the stillness of night which feels good.<br> But, it's not that I am focusing entirely on the asthetic beauty and the calmness. That happens subconsciously. What happens in foregoround? an explosion of ideas!<br> It makes me think about everything and about nothing. about trees and about grass. about moon and about light. about space and even about mars.
       And in between these moments of cereberal activities a stupid desire of clicking occurs, even if there is no interesting subject. This is the part where my crappy mobile camera comes. I know this is absurd but when I return home and see those pictures before sleeping, it feels good and fresh and forces me to wake in the morning to do something awesome.<br>
      So next time you want your creative juices flowing, take your favorite music with you and just go out after it gets dark. sleep well and keep creating! </p>
